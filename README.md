# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using MNIST Dataset

This project trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented in Python using the Keras package in TensorFlow.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** MNIST dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28x28 pixels.
- **Objective:** Train a neural network to classify handwritten digits.
- **Approach:**
  - Flatten the 28x28 pixel images into a 784-dimensional vector.
  - Use hidden layers with sigmoid or ReLU activation functions.
  - Evaluate the model using accuracy, recall, and precision metrics.
